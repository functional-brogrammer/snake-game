snake game in drracket

Creating a snake game in Racket using big-bang.
Already got the key handler set up, but I need help with the following things:
1. Creating boundaries along the perimeter of the window so the snake's trajectory gets redirected parallel to the boundary rather than continuing through.
2. Adjusting the draw handler to randomly place food on screen for the snake to eat.
3. Making sure the snake grows after passing through food, and that another food is generated somewhere else after the snake eats it.
